# mdadm configuration file
#
# mdadm will function properly without the use of a configuration file,
# but this file is useful for keeping track of arrays and member disks.
# In general, a mdadm.conf file is created, and updated, after arrays
# are created. This is the opposite behavior of /etc/raidtab which is
# created prior to array construction.
#

# When used in --follow (aka --monitor) mode, mdadm needs a
# mail address and/or a program.  This can be given with "mailaddr"
# and "program" lines to that monitoring can be started using
#    mdadm --follow --scan & echo $! > /var/run/mdadm
# If the lines are not found, mdadm will exit quietly
MAILADDR <%= node[:contacts][:hostmaster] %>
